# Dataset name

## Dataset details
- Dataset link:
- Fiboa dataset link (if converted): 
- Documentation link:
- License: 
- Geographic coverage:
- Approx. number of polygons:
- Label completeness: (e.g., all fields are labeled, the fields in a few regions are fully labeled, a small subset of fields are labeled)
- Method of creating boundaries: e.g., ground survey, hand-drawn on satellite imagery, etc.
- Train/val/test split provided? yes / no

## Quality checks
- [ ] No overlapping polygons
- [ ] Dates the boundaries are valid for is known and documented
- [ ] Polygons appear to match field boundaries in satellite images of the corresponding time period
- [ ] Type of crops in the field boundaries are known and documented (e.g., temporary/annual crops, permanent crops, specific types of crops, pasture, forest stands, etc.)
